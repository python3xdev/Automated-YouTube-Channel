# Automated-YouTube-Channel-Bot
A YouTube Channel managed by a bot written in python. (dev notes + setup info in the .py files)

I left the intro & outro in the custom_content folder from my test YT channel. This way there is something to test the program with.

Here are the results that the bot makes:

The channel will not manage itself because I am not hosting the bot on a server. I just run the program sometimes on my PC.
